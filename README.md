# Anagram Battle!!

Anagram Battle is a game that tests your ability to deconstruct words and reconstruct them into new words.
Go head to head with a variety of fearsome monsters, using your word knowledge to defeat them.  Come up
with 3 anagrams for the word given to send your foe to his doom.  Defeat all eight monsters
to become the supreme champion of vocabulary wisdom!
